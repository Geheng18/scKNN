\title{Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) Kernel}
\usage{
getCar(geno, maf, weights)
}
\arguments{
\item{geno}{Numeric matrix of genotype or expression data}

\item{maf}{Numeric vector of minor allele frequencies}

\item{weights}{Numeric vector of feature weights}
}
\value{
Symmetric CAR kernel matrix
}
\description{
Computes a conditional autoregressive kernel that accounts for genetic
correlation structure. Based on the Cholesky decomposition of a variance
matrix that incorporates population structure.
}
\details{
The CAR kernel is designed to account for population structure and
correlation patterns in genomic data. It uses the empirical correlation
structure to build a precision matrix.
