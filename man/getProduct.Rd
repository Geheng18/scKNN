\title{Product Kernel (Linear Kernel)}
\usage{
getProduct(geno, weights = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{geno}{Numeric matrix of features}

\item{weights}{Numeric vector of feature weights}
}
\value{
Symmetric product kernel matrix
}
\description{
Computes the standard inner product kernel, also known as linear kernel.
Measures linear relationships between samples.
}
\details{
The product kernel is K(x,y) = <x,y> / (m * sum(weights)) where <x,y>
is the inner product and m is the number of features.
