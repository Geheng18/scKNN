\title{Identity-By-State (IBS) Kernel}
\usage{
getIbs(geno, weights = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{geno}{Numeric matrix with genotype data (typically 0, 1, 2 encoding)}

\item{weights}{Numeric vector of feature weights}
}
\value{
Symmetric IBS kernel matrix
}
\description{
Computes identity-by-state kernel commonly used in genomics. Measures
allelic similarity between samples based on shared alleles.
}
\details{
The IBS kernel counts the number of shared alleles between individuals.
For diploid organisms, genotypes are typically coded as 0, 1, 2 representing
the number of alternative alleles.
